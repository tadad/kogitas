The university and school played a much more important part than in the South according to Catholic historians.

Again, in Germany, there were no princely patrons of arts and learning to be compared in intelligence and munificence to the Renaissance popes and the Medici.[citation needed] Nor was the new culture here exclusive and aristocratic.
