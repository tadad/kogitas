His refusal to renounce all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo\u00a0X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles\u00a0V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Holy Roman Emperor.\n", "collapsed": true}, {"id": 538063188596, "href": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer", "name": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "value": 67, "childLinks": [], "description": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer (/\u02c8dj\u028a\u0259r\u0259r/;[1] German: [\u02c8\u0294alb\u0281\u025b\u00e7t \u02c8dy\u02d0\u0281\u0250];[2][3][1] 21 May 1471 \u2013 6 April 1528),[4] sometimes spelt in English as Durer or Duerer (without an umlaut), was a German painter, printmaker, and theorist of the German Renaissance.

But it can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of Rubens, Jusepe de Ribera, Bernini, and Rembrandt. Famous while he lived, Caravaggio himself was forgotten almost immediately after his death. Many of his paintings were reascribed to his followers, such as The Taking of Christ, which was attributed to the Dutch painter Gerrit van Honthorst until 1990.[1] It was only in the 20th century that his importance to the development of Western art was rediscovered. In the 1920s Roberto Longhi once more placed him in the European tradition: \"Ribera, Vermeer, La Tour and Rembrandt could never have existed without him.

They advance Luther's positions against what he saw as the abuse of the practice of clergy selling plenary indulgences, which were certificates believed to reduce the temporal punishment in purgatory for sins committed by the purchasers or their loved ones. In the Theses, Luther claimed that the repentance required by Christ in order for sins to be forgiven involves inner spiritual repentance rather than merely external sacramental confession. He argued that indulgences led Christians to avoid true repentance and sorrow for sin, believing that they could forgo it by purchasing an indulgence. These indulgences, according to Luther, discouraged Christians from giving to the poor and performing other acts of mercy, believing that indulgence certificates were more spiritually valuable. Though Luther claimed that his positions on indulgences accorded with those of the Pope, the Theses challenge a 14th-century papal bull stating that the pope could use the treasury of merit and the good deeds of past saints to forgive temporal punishment for sins. The Theses are framed as propositions to be argued in debate rather than necessarily representing Luther's opinions, but Luther later clarified his views in the Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences.\n", "collapsed": true}, {"id": 882675214117, "href": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Western_civilization", "name": "History of Western civilization", "value": 236, "childLinks": [], "description": "Western civilization traces its roots back to Europe and the Mediterranean.
