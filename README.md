When there is a query, take the top 5(?) page ranks for that word
    and then do a BFS of 3(?) out to create and visualize the graph

Lowest leve: it should show you the relevant and their BFS outward
    Zoom out then then you see the relevant pages for the domain
    Zoom out even more and you see all the domains

Clusters need to be labelled - not just nodes
    Maybe it is useful to do a have pagerank at a low level
    Or just use page rank to get the relevant nodes based on keyword

When you click on a node it should open a page in a new tab

Video prototype would be good
Aesthetic should be 80s cyberpunk / wireframe grpahics. Has the advantage of making it lighter too
