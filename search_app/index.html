      <p id='main-info'> 
        Traditional search engines return a ranked list of webpages. This is great if you have a
        question that needs to be answered, but terrible if you don't even know what question to ask.
        I created kogitas because I have found traditional reccomendation algorithms to be very over-fit.
        Google thinks they know you better than you know yourself. This isn't true - it's just that their
        algorithm sucks, and we have adjusted our behavior to fit it.

        This demo is an approximation to what will happen when someone queries "Renaissance."

        As you can see, Kogitas generated a graph of people, places, things, and events related to the
        renaissance. In effect, the query is to explore the renaissance. Kogitas does not presuppose a
        correct answer to the query.

        Currently, I am working on a more sophisticated set of tools that will allow Kogitas to become a 
        general purpose search engine.
